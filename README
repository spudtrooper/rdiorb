* ABOUT

This is a ruby implementation of the rd.io API here:

  http:/developer.rdio.com


* USAGE

See the exmples for usage.  You first must obtain a consumer
key/secret pair described here:

  http:/developer.rdio.com

You can user the 'rdio-call' script (strikingly similar to rdio's
python one) for exploring the api.  Pass '-h' argument to rdio-call to
see the options.  Here's an example:

  % ./rdio-call get keys=t7609753 -i
  {
    "result": {
      "t7609753": {
        "artist": "Mogwai",
        "name": "White Noise",
  ....


* TESTS

In order to run the rests, you must define the following environmental
variables to the appropriate values:

 RDIO_KEY
 RDIO_SECRET

You must also serialize an authorized access token to the file
.rdio_access_token.  This can be done with:

 make .rdio_access_token

  -or-

 ./create_access_token
